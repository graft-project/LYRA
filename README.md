# LYRA
## GRAFT's Next Generation Proof-of-Stake based Blockchain for Merchant Tokens and Beyond

The main goal of LYRA is creating a platform capable of issuing and collecting (redeeming) tokens as payments alongside traditional transactions.  Such system has to be fast (point of sale fast), support unlimited throughput (TPS), be elastically scalable and eventually fully decentralized.  

LYRA is attempting to combine the best ideas and technologies currently available in crypto space, such as delegated proof of stake, sharding, and CryptoNote, and apply them to the tokenized financial payment network space. 

Lyra uses the latest techniques in DAG-style blocklist/blockchain design, supporting mobile wallets that don’t need “web wallet” implementations and getting rid of the TPS bottlenecks in the process.  
In fact Lyra possesses a lot of unique and interesting characteristics that make it a perfect fit for a lot of token implementations that benefit from point-of-sale compatibility.

- DAG-style chain collection / blocklist architecture
- Super Light Clients / Wallets
- Fungible and Non-fungible Tokens
- Pre-programmed Smart Contracts
- Instant Transactions
- Built-in Instant Token Exchange Capability
- Compatible with Point of Sale
- Flexible Transaction Fee Structure
