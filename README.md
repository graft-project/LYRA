# LYRA
## GRAFT's Next Generation Proof-of-Stake based Blockchain for Merchant Tokens and Beyond

The main goal of LYRA is creating a platform capable of issuing and collecting (redeeming) tokens as payments alongside traditional transactions.  Such system has to be fast (point of sale fast), support unlimited throughput (TPS), be elastically scalable and eventually fully decentralized.
