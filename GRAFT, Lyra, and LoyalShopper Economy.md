# GRAFT, Lyra, and LoyalShopper Economy
I would like to propose the following link (“tethering”) between GRAFT (and GRFT token), Lyra network, and any applications running on or using Lyra network (such as LoyalShopper). 
Such a link will open new opportunities for the GRAFT project and its supporters - in case Lyra is developed as part of Graft project.    
## Terminology
**GRAFT** - 1. Company and community developing GRAFT network and applications; 2. Decentralized privacy PoW blockchain network based on Cryptonote protocol.

**GRFT** - a cryptographic token that circulates in the GRAFT blockchain network. 

**Lyra**- 1. DPoS/DAG blockchain (blocklist) technology that provides out of the box real time authorizations, multi-token support, built-in decentralized exchange, and other features required for real world transaction processing; 2. Permissioned, centralized blockchain network (inintially) 3. Permissionless, decentralized DPoS blockchain network (next step).

**LoyalShopper**- Loyalty rewards, gift cards, store credit, and discount coupons program management system based on Lyra technology and Lyra network, with first implementation for Shopify and future integrations with other ecommerce and in-store point of sale platforms.
    
## Connection between GRFT, Lyra, and LoyalShopper
The most realistic way to bind GRAFT, Lyra, and LoyalShopper (and therefore, fund all these projects) is through tethering, i.e. creating a Lyra.GRFT token that would be 100% tethered to GRFT. Lyra.GRFT will be used as an internal Lyra network currency for transaction processing fees and DPoS voting once a decentralized network is launched.

Initially, right after Lyra mainnet launch, there will be zero Lyra.GRFT tokens in circulation. 
The first Lyra.GRFT will be created by exchanging GRFT to Lyra.GRFT by the GRAFT team. 
Some part of GRAFT company reserve fund will be “transferred” to Lyra.GRFT as the very first step in mainnet launch. 
The exchange will work in the way that it generates new Lyra.GRFT tokens when GRFT come in,
and burns Lyra.GRFT when GRFT come out of Lyra mainnet. 

Initially, GRAFT team will ensure that GRFT that enter exchange will remain untouched on the exchange wallet which will be publicly visible.
Eventually, this exchange process will become decentralized using distributed wallets maintained by the auithorizer nodes (the high level design already exists). 

## The benefits of GRFT-Lyra.GRFT tethering

**No need to fund expensive exchange listings.** Lyra token -- Lyra.GRFT  -- becomes liquid immediately after Lyra mainnet launch as the entire Lyra.GRFT circulation is backed by GRFT exchange wallet. If you own Lyra.GRFT, it is guaranteed that you can always exchange them to GRFT and you can exchange GRFT for BTC or other crypto on independent exchanges. Therefore, there is no need to finance exchange listings.

**GRFT token finally becomes utility token and gets a very well defined purpose**, which will help resolve potential legal issues and raise the GRFT value. GRFT holders will use Lyra.GRFT to process LoyalShopper reward points transactions or to resell to other users who want to process reward point transactions (not financial transactions!) within the Lyra network. GRAFT team will sell (through Shopify subscriptions) Lyra.GRFT tokens to merchants who use the LoyalShopper Shopify app that processes reward points transactions - not funds transfers. 

**GRAFT team and supporters will receive liquid earnings** from proceeds from transaction processing and DPoS voting. Lyra transaction fees are paid in Lyra.GRFT, which is convertible to GRFT. Fees are collected by the GRAFT team as long as the network is permissioned. Once decentralized permissionless DPoS network is implemented, the authorizer node owners and their voters will share the revenues. 

**GRFT will get a real value and become a stronger currency** because it is utilized to pay for real transactions. LoyalShopper Shopify app customers will pay app subscriptions to the GRAFT team in US dollars and other fiat and crypto currencies. The GRAFT team must provide some amount of Lyra.GRFT to the customer in exchange for the app subscription. At some point, the team might not have enough Lyra.GRFT in the reserve, and will have to buy GRFT on independent exchange to get more Lyra.GRFT to supply the LoyalShopper users. Another reason - third party developers, who use Lyra API as a platform for their solutions, will have to buy GRFT on independent exchanges to run their products.

**Lyra will instantly become a truly open platform** even before it is made decentralized and permissionless because everyone can buy GRAFT on independent exchange and fund their own “LoyalShopper-like” project on Lyra. Without GRFT tethering, Lyra gas token could be only purchased indirectly through Shopify or directly from the GRAFT team.

**GRAFT will provide privacy to Lyra transactions** from the beginning, 
even before the Lyra privacy layer is designed and implemented. 
In current design, Lyra transactions are not private. 
However, the high level design of private accounts and transactions, 
based on elements of Cryptonote protocol and other cryptographic algorithms, already exists.
This is a separate, long term project. But with Lyra.GRFT tethered to GRFT,
a private transfer, if necessary, can be done by converting Lyra.GRFT to GRAFT and making a private transaction on GRAFT blockchain.

**Lyra will not have its own underlying currency** but rather rely on external currency, 
which is one of the main principles that was proposed in the original Lyra white paper. 
Therefore, Lyra becomes a pure payment system, unlike other blockchains including Bitcoin, 
where currency and payment systems are combined in one monolith which makes them unsuitable in many applications. 
Eventually, Lyra will support more tokens tethered to other fiat and crypto currencies, 
which will enable instant decentralized exchange between multiple tokens and currencies.
